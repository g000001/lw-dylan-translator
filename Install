To compile:

o Load "demand-compiler.lisp"
o Wait.
o Wait.
o Etc.

To load manually:

o Load "demand-loader.lisp"

For convenience:

You can set up the translator to be (a) demand loaded and (b) accessible 
from the main LispWorks icon thus:

o Load the file "<install-dir>/main-resources.lisp" from your
  .lispworks (or, at any rate, before calling lw:start-lispworks).
