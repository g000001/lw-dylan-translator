Introduction

#1: Collection Class-For-Copy	(Clarification)
This design note clarifies that class-for-copy of a collection must 
return a mutable collection.

[OK]

#2: First, Second, Third, Last Default	(Addition)
This design note adds a default: keyword argument to the 
specification of the functions  first, second, third, and last.  This 
change removes a possible source of confusion by making these 
functions more consistent with the function element.

[CONFORMS]

#3: Make Class Specification 	(Addition)
This design note gives an expanded specification for <class> which 
enables new classes to be created at runtime, with make.

[CONFORMS + delayed-type: option]

#4: No Incremental Class Modifications	(Change)
This design note deletes the functions add-slot and remove-slot, the 
setter for direct-superclasses, and the macro define-slot from the 
Dylan language specification.

[DONE]

#5: Regularization of the Type System	(Change)
This design note outlines a more expressive type system for Dylan.  
Not all types in Dylan are classes.  For example, singleton types are 
not classes.  The new type system allows for a variety of types, 
including classes and singleton types, and also provides a framework 
for introducing additional types that are not classes.

#6: Limited Types	(Addition)
This design note introduces a new generic function, limited, for 
constructing limited types, and specific methods for creating limited 
integer types and limited collection types.   For example, (limited 
<integer> min: 0 max: 255) and (limited <array> of: <single-float>) 
are useful types.

#7: Union Types	(Addition)
This design note introduces a new facility for creating a union type 
as a union of two other types.   Union types are useful as slot 
specializers, and describe the return types of many common functions.  
For example, (union <integer> (singleton #f)) describes the return 
type of size.

#8: Method Dispatch Ambiguity	(Clarification)
Sometimes it is not clear which of two methods is the most specific 
for a particular function call.  This is a particular problem for 
non-class types because it is possible for an object to be an 
instance of two disjoint types, such as (limited <integer> min: 0) 
and (limited <integer> max: 10).  This design note requires Dylan to 
signal an error in such cases.

#9: Punt Slot Descriptors	(Change)
This design note deletes Dylan's specification of slot descriptors.  
This change removes a feature which is incomplete, which does not 
match our current goals, and which impedes efficient implementation.

[DONE]

#10: Element-Setter Signals Error	(Clarification)
It is an error if element-setter cannot successfully set the element 
of a sequence.  This design note requires an error to be signaled in 
that case, preventing programs from silently returning an incorrect 
result or otherwise failing.

[CONFORMS]

#11: Last-Setter	(Addition)
This design note adds a specification for the generic function last-
setter, consistent with the setters for first, second, third, and 
element.

[CONFORMS]

#12: Size-Setter for Stretchy Sequences	(Addition)
This design note adds the generic function size-setter to the 
language specification, allowing the size of a stretchy sequence to 
be changed in a single operation.

[CONFORMS]

#13: Type Restrictions Survive Assignment	(Change)
When a parameter or local variable is specialized, its initial value 
is required to be an instance of a certain type.  This design note 
extends the type restriction to cover values later stored into the 
specialized parameter or local variable.

#14: Union Allows Duplicates	(Clarification)
This design note clarifies that the result of union is only 
guaranteed free of duplicates if no element appears more than once in 
a single argument sequence.  If the same element appears more than 
once in a single argument sequence, it may appear more than once in 
the result sequence.  This allows union to be implemented more 
efficiently.

[OK]

#15: Replace-Subsequence! Different Sizes	(Change)
This design note extends the definition of replace-subsequence! to 
allow the old and new subsequences to have different sizes.  This 
change greatly increases the utility of replace-subsequence!, 
enabling it to be used for replace, insert and delete operations over 
any sequence.

#16: List Issues	(Change)
In this design note, Dylan's specification of the <list> type is made 
more consistent with the rest of the language, mysterious 
abbreviations and redundant list-only operations are removed, and 
handling of improper lists is clarified.  These changes make the 
language more accessible to our primary audience of programmers who 
have not used dynamic languages before.

[CONFORMS]

#17: Define Like Bind	(Addition)
This design note unifies the behavior of bind and define.  It  
extends  define to support declaring the types of  module variables 
and defining multiple module variables from multiple values.

[CONFORMS]

#18: Member? Intersection Test Arg	(Clarification)
This design note clarifies that the <range> methods for member? and 
intersection support a test: keyword argument, which defaults to id?.  
This makes the <range> methods consistent with the definitions for 
these generic functions.

[CONFORMS - the numeric type conversions (at least) are dodgy]

#19: Definitions are Declarative	(Change)
This design note distinguishes definitions from other syntax forms, 
making module variable definition essentially a declarative 
operation, not a procedural one.  Definitions are restricted to 
appear only at the top level.  A given module variable can only be 
defined once, except for multiple define-method definitions with 
different specializers.  Definitions do not return values, since they 
cannot appear as argument expressions.

#20: New Syntax for Setter Variables	(Change)
This design note changes the syntax for setter variables.  In the 
revised syntax, the setter corresponding to the getter foo is named 
foo-setter rather than (setter foo).  This removes the special case 
syntax for setters so that all variable names are symbols.

[CONFORMS]

#21: Result Type Declarations	(Addition)
This design note introduces a way to declare the result types of 
methods and generic functions.  This addition is intended to make 
code more self-documenting and allow for better compiler 
optimization.  Type declarations will be checked at run time unless 
they can be proven at compile time to be satisfied always.

[DODGY - accepts #values declarations but these are completely ignored]
